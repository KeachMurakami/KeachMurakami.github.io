## Warning in fread(LogFile): Bumped column 6 to type character on data
## row 13, field contains '185_'. Coercing previously read values in this
## column from logical, integer or numeric back to character which may not
## be lossless; e.g., if '00' and '000' occurred before they will now be just
## '0', and there may be inconsistencies with treatment of ',,' and ',NA,' too
## (if they occurred in this column before the bump). If this matters please
## rerun and set 'colClasses' to 'character' for this column. Please note
## that column type detection uses the first 5 rows, the middle 5 rows and the
## last 5 rows, so hopefully this message should be very rare. If reporting to
## datatable-help, please rerun and include the output from verbose=TRUE.
